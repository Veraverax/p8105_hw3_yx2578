Homework 3

Vera Xu

This is my solution to HW3.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
    fig.width = 6, 
  fig.asp = .6,
  out.width = "90%"
)
theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
options(
  ggplot2.continuous.colour = "viridis",
  ggplot2.continuous.fill = "viridis"
)
scale_colour_discrete = scale_colour_viridis_d
scale_fill_discrete = scale_fill_viridis_d
```

### Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contains 1384617 rows and … columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by user. There are user /
order variables – user ID, order ID, order day, and order hour. There
are also item variables – name, aisle, department, and some numeric
codes.

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

Let’s make a plot

``` r
instacart %>% 
    count(aisle) %>% 
    filter(n > 10000) %>% 
    mutate(
        aisle = factor(aisle),
        aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + 
    geom_point() + 
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

Let’s make a table\!\!

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
    group_by(aisle) %>% 
    count(product_name) %>% 
    mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
    filter(rank < 4) %>% 
    arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
    knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

Apples vs ice cream..

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

### Question 2

##### Load and tidy the data

``` r
p2_df = 
  read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  pivot_longer(
   activity_1:activity_1440,
   names_prefix = "activity_",
   names_to = "min",
   values_to = "activity"
   ) %>%
   mutate(
    weekday = ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), FALSE, TRUE),
    min = as.numeric(min),
    day = factor(day, 
                 levels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday")
                 ) 
    )%>%
  arrange(day) %>%
  select(-day_id)
```

  - The resulting dataset contains 5 columns and 50400 rows.
  - Variables are: week, day of the week, weekday (True or False),
    minute of the day and activity.

##### Total activity of each day

Total activity of each day is computed using the following code chunk:

``` r
p2_df %>%
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity))%>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

| week | day       | total\_activity |
| ---: | :-------- | --------------: |
|    1 | Sunday    |       631105.00 |
|    1 | Monday    |        78828.07 |
|    1 | Tuesday   |       307094.24 |

|    2 | Thursday  |       474048.00 |
|    2 | Friday    |       568839.00 |
|    2 | Saturday  |       607175.00 |
|    3 | Sunday    |       467052.00 |
|    3 | Monday    |       685910.00 |
|    3 | Tuesday   |       381507.00 |
|    3 | Wednesday |       468869.00 |
|    3 | Thursday  |       371230.00 |
|    3 | Friday    |       467420.00 |
|    3 | Saturday  |       382928.00 |
|    4 | Sunday    |       260617.00 |
|    4 | Monday    |       409450.00 |
|    4 | Tuesday   |       319568.00 |
|    4 | Wednesday |       434460.00 |
|    4 | Thursday  |       340291.00 |
|    4 | Friday    |       154049.00 |
|    4 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |
|    5 | Sunday    |       138421.00 |
|    5 | Monday    |       389080.00 |
|    5 | Tuesday   |       367824.00 |
|    5 | Wednesday |       445366.00 |
|    5 | Thursday  |       549658.00 |
|    5 | Friday    |       620860.00 |
|    5 | Saturday  |         1440.00 |

  - It seems that this person tend to have a stable level of activity
    over the weekdays, with some extremely low or high levels on certain
    weekends.
  - It also seems like this person is more active during week 3.

##### Activity level plot by day

``` r
p2_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = min, y = activity)) + 
  geom_line(aes(colour = day), alpha = 0.5)
```

<img src="p8105_hw3_yx2578_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" width="90%" />

  - It looks like this person is active during daytime and not active
    over the night.
  - There are several peaks of activity during weekdays in the mornings
    and evenings.
  - This person is more active during weekdays, in general.

### Question 3

The goal is to do some exploration of this dataset. To that end, write a
short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the
data, describing some key variables, and indicating the extent to which
missing data is an issue. Then, do or answer the following (commenting
on the results of each):

  - Do some data cleaning. Create separate variables for year, month,
    and day. Ensure observations for temperature, precipitation, and
    snowfall are given in reasonable units. For snowfall, what are the
    most commonly observed values? Why?
  - Make a two-panel plot showing the average max temperature in January
    and in July in each station across years. Is there any observable /
    interpretable structure? Any outliers?
  - Make a two-panel plot showing (i) tmax vs tmin for the full dataset
    (note that a scatterplot may not be the best option); and (ii) make
    a plot showing the distribution of snowfall values greater than 0
    and less than 100 separately by year.

##### Load and tidy the data

``` r
p3_df =
  ny_noaa %>%
  separate(date, c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.numeric(year),
    month = as.numeric(month),
    day = as.numeric(day),
    prcp = as.numeric(prcp)*0.1,
    tmax = as.numeric(tmax)*0.1,
    tmin = as.numeric(tmin)*0.1)
```

  - The tidied dataset contains 9 columns and 2595176 rows.

  - Variables are: weather station ID, year, month, day, precipitation
    (in mm), snowfall (in mm), snow depth (in mm), maximum temperature
    (in degree C), minimum temperature (in degree C).

  - Make a plot showing the average max temperature in January and in
    July
